QUICK GUIDE

# Move using ZQSD

# Pick up items using SPACE_BAR
- pick up an SCBA (Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus) to be able to breathe in fire environment
- pick up a firehose at the back of your truck to fight fires (need to put on SCBA first)

# Use FireHose using the mouse:
1. Left Mouse Button:
    - straight spray
    - longest reach
    - highly effective against burning material
    - ineffective against smoke
2. Right Mouse Button:
    - largest spray
    - smallest reach
    - higly effective to cool down a room
    - not very effective on burning objects
3. Middle Mouse Button
    - middle everything

# Drop items using G
- drop a firehose at the back of your truck will coil it in instead of dropping it on the ground

# Get in truck using E
- will generate a new level from station
- will take you back to station if mission is accomplished

# Check bodyguard using TAB
- displays air left in tank
